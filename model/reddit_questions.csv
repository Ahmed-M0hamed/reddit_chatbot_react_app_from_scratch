I almost spit out my drink. ""Well, I've never done that before -"" 

""I have,"" he interrupted. So I was like, well if you say so.

And honestly? She was better than the other one. She did her meth business in hotel rooms. She paid cash on time. She wasn’t home a lot. One time she left her little meth scale in the living room, and it inspired me to get a food scale which was a game changer in my weight loss journey (a serving of spaghetti is pathetically small and I had no idea until I weighed it).

She was an unemployed student, like me, who would use the cups from my dinner set as ashtrays, and load up a single plate of food, take it to her room, eat from it throughout the day, and keep it. Rinse, repeat every day until we were out of plates. I said I'd clean them if she just brought them back to the kitchen, but nah.

(I was having a time in my personal life). So I move in to the trailer and paid like $200/month for the trailer and access to the house. The other roommates were paying I think $300/month each. 

Well one thing led  to another and I started dating one of the roommates, let’s call him Ben. So Ben and I are hanging out, it seems all good, I’m spending more nights than not in Ben’s room. Sean had even encouraged Ben and me to date so I thought he was happy for us. 

One day Sean came home in a blind rage and kicked me out of the house (I was sitting in the living room watching tv with the other roommates.) He locked me out of the house and disconnected the electricity from the house to the tiny trailer… in January. I asked him to talk to me about what was going on and he point blank refused to acknowledge my existence but didn’t seem to have much of a problem with Ben.

1) cooking myself dinner and not offering him any

2) not buying nice beer for him 

3) having a relationship with Ben

The poor guy's life was terrible. He dropped out of high school at age 17. Then he started selling weed, which he was arrested for by an undercover cop. Being uneducated, he ended up with a felony on his record, permanently.

Throw on top of that, having a child and things not working out with his baby momma, so he owed child support. This guy was working as a dishwasher at restaurants for $10 an hour (probably less, this was from 2010-2015 when we were roommates). He had no car, and the closest bus rout to where we lived was a mile walk (uphill) from our apartment. He did this every day. One day I was talking to my dad, who loves to ride bicycles and has many, if one could be offered to my friend. He put some new pedals on a road bike of his (that's all he had), and I gave it to my friend.

On the third day after he had been given the bike, I was awoken randomly to knocks on my bedroom door and some mumbled speech. I open my door and there's my roommate, with his hand up to his face, covered in blood and maybe a tooth in there. He had placed his bag of clothes on the handlebar, and the drag from the front tire pulled the bag in and caused him to faceplant on concrete.

I remember taking him to the hospital, and he asked me to look at his mouth...good god.

This has a happy ending (or something like it). After this injury, he had enough with walking to the bus, so he got a second job, and began saving up to buy a car. For the first few weeks though, this guy was walking to the bus, and then working a 16+ hour day. There was a gap between jobs, where he couldn't rest much, so was probably getting 4 hours of sleep a night. He was saving funds and due to his child support, he could only eat Banquet $1 frozen dinners. All day. That's all he had was one of those. He eventually got the car and his quality of life got marginally better before he parted ways.

He ended up moving in with family and closer to bus lines. Maybe not the most extraordinarily interesting story ever, but nonetheless, what that guy went through, I can't imagine. He used to tell me when he was walking home at night, he often contemplated stepping into oncoming traffic. Thankfully he never did.

After we both left the apartment and went our separate ways, we kept in touch. However, he frequently had phone issues when we lived together, and had several different #s in 5 years. I reached out to him to check in 5 years ago and never heard back. I hope he's ok.

Needless to say, the next 6 months were not fun. He left his spit cups everywhere, constantly played loud country music, and messed around with my stuff (including scratching a nasty slur into my Office Space-esque stapler).

Long story short, he was kicked out of the dorms about 2 weeks before the spring break - he and another guy went on a rampage through the dorm with Airsoft guns shooting the little whiteboard on everyone's door. For some reason, though, he was allowed to stay until the break. I stupidly left for home before he did, and when I got back my very nice gaming PC was missing. I reported it missing, and told the police exactly where I thought it was (at his new place).

In 2007 I went backpacking around Australia and lived in a house share in Sydney for a bit. I shared my room with a guy I had met at a hostel previously.

Sadly, my best friend at home in the UK died very suddenly and unexpectedly which obviously left me completely devastated. I really wanted to get home quickly to be with my circle of friends and support system, so I booked the first flight I could afford which was about a week later.
My landlord at the time was not at all sympathetic to my situation and told me he was going to keep all of my deposit, so in an effort to try to appease him and hopefully get some back, I immediately set about finding a new room mate via sites like gumtree so that my room wasn’t left empty. There were a few applicants and after a few days I found a girl who seemed cool and like she’d fit in with the rest of the household so we made arrangements for her to move in. (Despite this my landlord still said he wasn’t going to give me my deposit back, so I nearly didn’t bother, but I really liked all of my housemates and I didn’t want them to end up with a lemon).

I go home and obviously have a very sad time for quite a long time. But I stay in touch with my housemates and they love this new girl, who fits in to the household perfectly. 
Next thing I know, she and my old roommate from the hostel start dating. Then they spend the next two years travelling the world together. I was so happy for them. They then move to Canada together. I visited them once and it was cool to see my old roomie again and get to know his girlfriend that I had unknowingly picked out from gumtree applicants. It’s now been 15 years and not only are they still together, but they have two beautiful children together. 

I still miss my best friend after all these years, but it brings me a lot of comfort to know that the chain of events caused by her passing resulted in a beautiful love story and two new babies."

His explanation? He must have been sleepwalking and ate it in his sleep. This happened 15 to 20 times over a year period. Minimum. He would make these big song and dances about how what I was making was gross, so I would put up enough leftovers for two (my boyfriend and I) then go to bed. What was to be lunches for work gone and often dirty utensils in the sink. 

Fast forward another 5 years and he called me at 3 am after not talking to me or my partner for 3 years, and told me my now husband (aforementioned BF)was doing Crack in front of our 4 year old. I called my husband, who was asleep. Neither of us had talked to him in years...what was this? 

Fast forward another 5 years. He's on death row for killing his roommate. His defense? He did it sleepwalking."

Cyclists can be strange and my roommate (""John"") was no exception. He grew up Quaker. His parents had recently divorced and his mom was in the process of building a house (mansion, really) in the immediate D.C. area next door to her ex-husband, and the houses were identical. They were filthy rich and he got whatever he wanted. I should mention, he specifically came to this school to race mountain bikes but he'd never raced bicycles at all, or even owned a mountain bike. He showed up to school on the first day with a $5000 road bike and a $7000 mountain bike. Anytime he went shopping, he almost always used change. He had the largest jar of change I'd ever seen.

When I say he was odd, he was just not quite there. He was taking 70mg vyvanse but he couldn't pay attention to anything for an extended period of time. So, he'd always interrupt conversations with some outta this world thought and he frequently left the room having forgot to wear something like socks or a shirt. Kinda hard to explain because, there wasn't really anything wrong with him, he was just never quite there. As an example, on a team trip one time we went to Cracker Barrell. He was very quiet for 45 minutes or so as everyone is talking about the race we just went to. All of a sudden, in a manner that everyone in the building can hear, he articulates a thought that has occurred to him: ""everyone here is old except for us."" Certainly true, just no need to say it out loud, ya know. While writing this, it has occurred to me that the amphetamines he'd been prescribed since childhood probably took a toll on his brain.

Anyways, he was honestly pretty fun to have around because you never quite knew what was going to happen. We roomed together off campus again sophomore year with two other guys on the cycling team. The summer between sophomore and junior year, he was supposed to study abroad in Austria for two weeks. Me and the other roommates joked, somewhat seriously, that it very well could be the last time we see John. If anyone was capable of getting lost abroad, it was him.

A few weeks before the trip, he confided with us that he met an Italian girl online and he was hoping to meet her while abroad. As he was beginning to pack, he showed us a selfie she just sent him. She appeared to be a passenger in a car and wearing a seatbelt. He was certain that, because she was looking out the window, it was a desparate plea for help and he needed to save her.

On his second day abroad, I received a call from his mother. I knew exactly what was on the other line. I put the phone call on speaker so the roommates could receive the same information that was certain to follow.

""This is carrot.""

""Have you heard from John?""

""Uhhh, no. He's in Austria.""

""The school called and he's gone missing. They can't find him.""

So we told his mom about the girl. The mom ended up hiring a PI who was able to track him down five days later roaming the streets of some small town on the Italy border. He was expelled from the university and I never saw him again - hired movers got his stuff from our apartment. He had totally ruined the study abroad trip for everyone. We asked him what happened but we never got a meaningful response.

He's sent me a couple of incredibly random facebook messages over the years. Once, he messaged me ""what degrees did you achieved?"" I responded and he messaged me back six months later, ""that's really cool that you are successful, who else do I know that is successful?"""

We were just millennial college partiers, a little shorter than most.... and smoked a lot of weed.

Our third roommate was from the Ukraine. He was 6' 7"" was extremely athletic, and was into UFC. Every time we would have a party (every week), he would get rather ruthless. He would lose his shirt. He would pull out the Stolichnaya and make my roommate drink ruthlessly until there was not much consciousness left of him. He used to choke us out for fun. He had a stairway beer bong he called The Alcohol Express Lane. He always had a bottle of Stolichnaya with him. The more drunk he got, the more Russian he would speak.

We had the cops looking for him one time, over a report of a neighbors fence he demolished while drinking. He broke every plate in our house one night. He headbutted the fridge, made a dent in it, followed by blood pouring down his face.  


He had pet scorpions he would let crawl on his shirtless body. We called him the Ukraine Train or Turbo, and he called my room mate Half-Speed and me Tumbleweed.

He had a thing for large women.

He laughed at his own blood.

He only lasted one semester.  After winter break, I never saw him again and my other roommate transferred."

* The guy who came here ""for university"" but, really, for legal recreational marijuana. He spent all his money on weed and video games, and almost got evicted for not paying rent, so his brother drove down and gave him rent money... which he promptly spent on more weed. That was a fun shouting match between the guy and the landlord.
* A girl who moved in, was utterly unremarkable in the sense of zero drama, and was genuinely pleasant the entire time. And then she stole a bunch of people's stuff and moved out.
* Aforementioned girl's boyfriend who moved in as a separate tenant with her. The boyfriend's best friend came with him. The best friend was like the human version of a Chihuahua --he thought he owned the place, wanted to fight everyone, but was so tiny he wasn't exactly threatening. He ate everybody's food and used up everybody's toilet paper to the point he started pilfering paper towels for wiping. Landlord decided the best response was make him sign a lease. He didn't pay. Landlord ""evicted"" him only for him to still hover around anyway. The boyfriend moved out and Chihuahua Guy left with him.
* A girl who toured the place, met everyone, moved in, and then moved out citing she felt ""unsafe"" because there were too many guys. Not knocking her for prioritizing her safety but, like, she knew how many guys lived there well before she signed a lease.... (There may be more to that story that I'll never know.)
* A guy who would sit on the couch and partake from a wax dab rig for hours on end. Forget ""high"". That man was *stratospheric*.
* An older lady who was basically Female Keith Richards --at least by lore. She had stories involving just about every kind of drug. She had a cute dog and I snuggled that dog every single day.
* The guy who turned out to be on the sex offender registry. He didn't do anything to me or anybody else, but I learned my lesson to background check roommates. Found out when a cop knocked while he was away.
* The guy who's only furniture in his room was a tent. He slept in a tent. In a room. I was honestly impressed.
* The guy who was only there for about three months because he had finished two degrees at once and just needed a place to crash while he searched for a job."

When me and my husband were just dating her moved into a 3br apt with 3 roommates. A really good friend of his and his GF and another single dude they all worked with. They signed and 18month lease. 

It was horrible. 

The couple (his friend and the guy's GF) started getting into hard core drugs after a really tragic event happened in their lives. They would have sketchy people over all the time, made huge messes, rarely cleaned anything and would get into shouting matches at 2am almost every night. The power was in the GF's name, and they almost always were late paying the bill. Eventually both got fired from their jobs and after spending all their money of drugs stopped paying rent. 

Single guy was the most disgusting human I have ever met. He would almost never shower and when he did, he didn't use anything but water. No shampoo no soap. He was an avid gamer and would be up for days on end playing games in his room. He would leave food out to rot, piss in bottles etc etc. Never cleaned his clothes. At one point there was a cat in the apt (long story) and single dude went to work. People were complaining he stank, so he blamed that the cat had pissed on his work shirt. I have so much to say about that, but his logic was the cat pissed on his shirt, but he put it on anyway? There was a full washer and dryer in the apt. No excuse. When the couple stopped paying rent so did he. 

Finally, the couple broke up so they both moved out and the single dude decided living on his own was too hard and moved back in with his mom. All this went down in under 4 months. Luckily the apt complex let my husband transfer to 1br in the same complex without breaking his lease. I moved in with him then, so at least that was good. 

He and I went into that 3br with hazmat suits and scrubbed it for like 2 days. Still didn't get the deposit back...can't say I blame them. That apt was FUCKED. 

Husbands' friend ended up getting into meth, dealing, cooking and doing. Was arrested and went to jail for over a year. He is clean and sober now and doing really well! So, a little bit of a happy ending."

After taking a moment to register just how weird this was, I stepped over by his speaker and turned the volume down a tad. Thats when his eyes shot open and without turning his head he just said ""What are you doing?"". I shit my pants internally and meekly responded ""Oh sorry, I thought you were asleep.

He found a Craigslist roommate to sublease and take over from him, kid was a creeper from the start. He was never home, and if he was, he was playing video games with his equally sketchy friends.

Anyways, I get home one night from work (worked as a cook, so long hours and late nights), and my front door had been kicked in.

It gets better. I don’t see him for a while, then randomly the police show up at the door asking about him.

The dumbass had busted into people’s places by climbing down the back patio, and since everyone (myself included), never assumed anyone could get up to those back doors, none of the patio doors were locked (for context, this is in the mountains in NC, our condo building was literally built of the side of a mountain. No idea how he managed to climb to the other units).

Genius here had robbed all of their places, then literally left footprints in the snow right back to our apartment. Thankfully the police already knew he’d robbed another place, so they didn’t suspect me, and my boss vouched that I was at work when they believe they robberies occurred.

* Became an LSD dealer, by ordering LSD on the dark net TO OUR DORM mailbox, and the blotters would arrive in between two stapled sheets of paper that were bullshitted to look like we received an actual letter.
* Built some big antenna contraption thing in our room so that he could beam WIFI to the parking lot outside of the dorms (which is where the smoker's shelter was where he spent a lot of time).
* Started a cricket fighting ring. He kept the crickets in cups he stole from the dining hall in our dorm. They chirped in the middle of the night.
* Broke his clavicle wrestling at 3AM in the woods near our college with other stoners. I had to convince him to call emergency medical services otherwise he would have just sat in our room screaming and moaning all night.
* Emptied out his dorm wardrobe, and put a big fish tank in it. He then stole some fish from the university's pond. The tank was never cleaned and it smelled horrible.
* Fed a tab of LSD to one of above fish and it never behaved the same again.
* Took the bathroom door of someone else's dorm off the hinge to use as a laptop table where he could play minecraft (with other degenerates from our hall).

The next year, he moved into an off campus apartment with one of my friends. When visiting my friend, I would witness more of his antics:

* Building a forge in their backyard (by forge I mean a hole in the ground where he was melting aluminum foil into ""ingots"" for fun).
* Threw a party inviting several drug dealers (who were not even students at our school), one of which stole my friend's PS4.
* Installed listening devices in their apartment during a conflict with his other roommates.
* Just in general inviting many drug dealers and strangers into the apartment on a routine basis.

My friend eventually kicked him out and got better roommates by the end of college. The one redeeming quality is that for a brief time, the guy got interested in baking decent bread."

She eventually moved out when a 3rd roommate moved in and completely killed the chill vibe we had going. She was awful. Super messy, very whiny, couldn’t respect boundaries. 

We all went our separate ways and didn’t stay in touch. I don’t think  could do the roommate thing again."

I’m assuming the thing she heard was about dorms with those tiled ceilings.

At the time, I was at a training school for my job and my first roommate had graduated and was leaving, so I was due to get a new one.

My new roommate didn't arrive on time due to some kind of complication at the airport he was departing from, so he ended up showing up just before 7am on a Sunday rather than Friday night like he was supposed to. I was dead asleep nursing a hangover when he threw the door open, moved a few random items onto his half of the room, and shook me awake.

I groggily open my eyes, barely awake and he says to me, ""Hey, I'm supposed to be your roommate but my buddy has an apartment in town, so I'll be staying there instead."" I mumbled something to the effect of ""Whatever"" and went back to sleep. Didn't see him again for a few weeks, thought he was the best roommate ever cause he occupied the room slot but didn't use it. That was, however, until he got caught rooming in town without authorization.

Rather than own up and admit to his superiors that he had basically decided to do that of his own free will, he tried to pass off that he couldn't bear to stay in our barracks room because of how bad everything smelled. I, naturally, didn't hear anything of this until my sleep was again interrupted on a day off I had from work for a surprise room inspection. The senior enlisted doing the inspection was my boss and he was very apologetic since I had worked for him without issue for a few months now.

They do the cursory inspection required by the order from above and determine my roommate was full of shit. He ends up getting put on restriction for it and spends a few weeks in a different barracks for the folks in trouble. All said and done, I had a ghost of a roommate for nearly two months before he got off restriction and was forced to actually start living in the barracks like he was supposed to. He never even apologized for trying to get me in trouble to save his own ass."

So, I'm home on Christmas Eve, late, trying to sleep as I was in some pain. I was curled up at the foot of the bed. I heard a gun shot and could smell cordite. Since those were early days of ""drive by shootings"" I felt sure that was what had happened. I laid there for a long while, terrified, and then got up and went to pound on his door. No answer. I didn't have a phone (poor student) so I walked a block to a store and used the pay phone to call the police.

The police arrived and found that the ceiling of my apartment had been shot through from the room above. The cops told me he was trying to clean a gun (high no doubt) and it went off. Even though he KNEW I was living right below the room he was in? He didn't even bother to check to see if I was OK or not. Much less answer the door when I loudly pounded on it.

The next day, I found the bullet slug, right below my pillow in the bed. Had I been sleeping ""right"" in the bed? I would have been shot or killed. 

I moved out shortly after and he ended up being charged and going to jail for the incident."

I had two roommates in college, we'll call them Brad and Trad. I was a junior and they were both freshmen. I told them my only rule was no marijuana in the dorm because I was on scholarship and the least that would happen if they found it was that my scholarships would be taken away, and I had no other way to pay for school. Beyond that I was cool with whatever. They agreed, and everything seemed cool.

One night, on Trad's 18th birthday, they invited a bunch of their friends over and some random people off the street apparently, and started drinking. I was like fuck this noise, and left to go play pool at the student center with a friend. 

A few hours later, me and my friend come back to find the living room and the hallways PAVED in beer cans, there was a giant construction ROAD CLOSED sign in the middle of the living room, and everyone gone but two random guys, who I'd never seen before, smoking weed in my bathroom with the shower on. I told them my rule and asked them to leave, and they were cool about it and told me Brad and Trad had told them it was totally ok as long as they smoked in the shower. I guess they must have done it once or twice and I hadn't noticed so they thought it was cool, having totally missed the point (I partook occasionally myself, but off-campus, because I was not an idiot). I had not asked them not to because of the smell, but Brad and Trad were very *special* individuals. 

For example, neither of them knew how to cook or clean, and Brad thought for some reason they paired them up with *me* because *I* was going to be cooking and cleaning for them, a notion of which I disabused them the very first time Trad said ""Hey, look, you've missed making dinner the past three days, and my laundry isn't going to do itself"" the first week I knew them. They also, as a prank, put my ice trays in the oven, and almost set the dorm on fire.

But I digress. Twenty minutes after the two randos left the dorm, and my friend and I were a few rounds into a game of Smash Bros Melee, someone came banging on the door. It was like 1am, and all my friends would have texted me first, so I assumed it was some of Brad and Trad's friends and I didn't bother to even ask who it was. Thirty seconds later the RA unlocks the door, and five police rush into the apartment.

Hearing the noise, I open the door to my room, and am greeted by a cop with his hand on his gun. A brief and totally sober conversation with the RA and the officers had revealed that Brad and Trad and company had broken the screen out of our window and had been throwing beer bottles at people walking down the street. They hit a guy and apparently he was being treated for a concussion at the hospital, and wanted to press charges. They'd also broken the windshield on some lady's car. Apparently shortly after that they bailed to go to the strip club, because 10 minutes later they come carousing into the apartment, faces covered in glitter, drunk and high to the extent they didn't even realize there were cops in the apartment, and they tried to go back to their rooms and couldn't understand why they weren't being allowed for a good 5 minutes.

The ending to that story was that Brad's lawyer father had somehow managed to get the charges dropped, and the two boys only had to do community service and some alcohol training and give some kind of presentation at a student gathering about the dangers of alcohol and drugs. But the real story starts when Brad and Trad decide they don't like me and the only way they're going to get out of the housing arrangement was to do a semester at sea off the coast of Africa.

Six glorious months go by with me alone in the apartment while Brad and Trad did two semesters at sea, and one day my RA comes by to tell me that they're retrieving Brad and Trad's things, and asked me if I would be willing to be a character witness for the school at a hearing regarding Brad and Trad's conduct while overseas. I said sure, what have they done now, and the RA offered up this story, which was supplemented by the information I got at the hearing.

Brad and Trad were still not 21 years of age, but the yacht upon which they were doing semester at sea had a cash bar, and they did not check IDs. The yacht was traveling up and down the west coast of Africa, where they would pull into various ports and a special guest speaker would come aboard and do a talk about African history or politics or contributions, etc. 

Apparently, they never attended a single talk, and so did not realize who they were accosting when one of those *very special guests*, purportedly a very influential peace loving former president of a South African country but whose identity was never confirmed at the hearing, was making his way back to his room with his body guards when he came upon the two sprawled out drunk on deck. He apparently admonished them for representing their school and country so poorly, which they did not take kindly to, and Trad grabbed the special guest by the shirt and managed to threaten to throw him overboard before he got tackled to the ground. Brad attempted to help Trad, and both of them ended up soundly beaten... and THEN spent the rest of the weekend in a South African jail with a few broken ribs and missing teeth. The *special guest* was kind enough not to press charges, and the two idiots were bundled up and flown back to the US, where they swore up and down that they were being framed, and the school held a formal hearing to determine whether or not they would be expelled. 

When they asked the RA who might make for an impartial character witness, she referred me, and I had the honor of expressing their countless stupid attempts to ruin my academic career, their various illegal exploits, and my opinion that they may genuinely not have the capacity to understand that what they did was wrong.

They were expelled. Last I heard, Brad was in and out of jail for a while, and Trad became a stand-up comic, failed miserably, and moved to LA to try to become an actor. He shortly thereafter changed his name and deleted his social media accounts."

When he was high he'd get the munchies real bad. Several times when high he bought hundreds of dollars worth of food or snacks at the campus Starbucks. He would also eat whatever he could find in the room, even if it wasn't his.

Another roommate, Clay, came home drunk one night with some leftover pizza. J had been smoking and decided to mess with Clay by telling him he was going to eat his pizza. He didn't really intend to eat it, but he knew he had that reputation and was just teasing the drunk guy. This went back and forth, with J telling Clay that he was going to eat his pizza and Clay becoming defensive and telling him he'd better not.

In order to keep his pizza safe, drunk Clay decided that he'd hide it. His chosen place? Inside a washing machine in the dorm's communal laundry room, which was a few doors down from our room. He put the whole pizza box inside the machine. 

The next morning Clay went to retrieve his pizza and found the box in the laundry room trash, apparently empty. He got pissed and confronted J, accusing him of stealing his pizza from the washing machine. J didn't even know he had hid it in there. He tried to tell Clay that he had only been messing with him and he didn't eat the pizza, but of course Clay didn't believe him. 

A few days later, another roommate, Mike, was eating pizza in the room. I told him the story and we decided to mess with Clay more. When he arrived home, Mike was still eating his pizza. He told Clay ""Dude try this pizza. You'll never believe it, but I found it in the washing machine. Who puts a perfectly good pizza in the washing machine?"" Clay freaked out, ""What?!? That's my pizza! Put it down!""

TLDR - drunk roommate put a box of pizza inside the dorm's communal washing machine to hide it from high roommate who told him he was going to eat it. Formerly -drunk roommate went to retrieve the pizza the next morning and saw the box in the trash, confronted formerly-high roommate, revealing that he had hid the pizza in the washer. A few days later another roommate and I told the formerly-drunk roommate that we found a pizza in the washer and were eating it - he believed us and freaked out again."

He knew we were going to the same college. After like 15 minutes of chat he started flirting with me, most notably saying “do you jerk off often?” Which would typically be creepy to me but I was experiencing an episode of sorts and I’d never been hit on by a guy. We agreed to be fuckbuddies. 

When I first meet him he’s very quiet, and when he starts talking he sounds exactly like Ben Shapiro and my attraction to him disappears. I try to have a good time with him regardless and offer him weed and we both gets high. Almost immediately he starts ranting a bunch of shit like “no one cares about me, not my mom, my sister, my dad, no one. I am a narcissist I don’t care about anyone.” Went on for like 15 minutes while I sat still in silence. 

I immediately tried to change roommates but every room was full. Fuck. I told him that that made me uncomfortable and he actually apologized, and I said well sounds like you’re not a narcissist then but there will be no sex. 

Moving forward he does creepy shit like leaving a cum rag in my closet and pretending to be asleep in the morning and staring at me, mostly he screamed at me for random shit while our neighbors could definitely hear. The last straw was the night I stayed up until 9am, and started taking a power nap. I woke up to loud violent banging on the door, so I shot out of bed and tried to get to the door but it shot open and he came in, slammed the door, screaming at me “I CANT RELY ON YOU TO DO ONE GOD DAMN THING FOR ME” like we’re a married couple or some shit because apparently while I was DEAD asleep he told me he lost his key and to let him back in when he comes back (he ended up having to go to a different floor and get a spare key which takes about 5 minutes), I have no memory because I was in dreamland but ok. I can’t take it anymore and I screamed back. Weirdest thing is in the middle of his screaming he giggled for a second before going back into the screaming. Eventually he storms out and slams the door (our poor neighbors). Just to prove what an asshole he is I begin looking for his key. I walk to his desk, scan it, lift a towel on the left side, and there it is. Took me all of 4 seconds. 

Later that day Im walking down the sidewalk thinking about how I need to completely reevaluate how I acted around him to avoid conflict. For whatever reason I’m on my phone in the phone app and I check the voicemails. I have one from him, and it’s around the same time we had the fight. In the voicemail he says “motherFUCKER, I told you to STAY UP, and LET ME IN, and now I have to go back down to the 5th floor, cuz you decided to fu- GOD dammit. This is why we can’t have nice fucking things, I’m gonna beat the FUCK out of you when I get back here, UNDERSTAND.” 

My first reaction was fear, but then I realized, 
now I have valid probable cause to get away from this dickhead. I go to my RA, who takes me to her boss, who takes me to 2 cops, and after that I was temporarily placed in a safe room and then given a new roommate.

So yeah, pretty interesting if I do say so myself."

That was weird enough, until one decided that she wanted to be more than roommates.  I was not interested (I had a girlfriend and she knew it) but every time I gently reminded her of that she caused untold drama in the apartment.  She tried to turn the other girl against me, but I had known her for years.  Still, it got stranger and stranger.

It turned out, years later, that the other roommate (the one I knew for years) was into me and was gently pushing the dramatic one at me, hoping I'd do something with her so that my GF would dump me and she'd have a shot - without any blame falling on her!

Girl is super pretty, chill, and driven. Going to a top notch university and about to graduate top of her class. Honestly no idea how he scored her (the rest of my roommates agree). 


Fast forward a few weeks. The semester is ending and our lease is expiring. Other roommates move out early. The night before we have to leave (must be out by 10 am), girl comes over. My stuff is all packed up by the door. She asks why I'm moving out. I tell her our lease is ending and I chose not to renew. She asks roommate if he is staying. He replies, ""No, I should probably start packing."" She says she can help him if he wants. 


She ends up staying until 2 am packing his stuff while he watches a couple movies. He had A LOT of stuff...hoarder type fella. There was a very hard line going down the center of our room of carpet on my side and no carpet on his side (due to about a foot-high pile of stuff and crap). At least he kept it on his side while we were rooming together. 


The morning of, he realizes his new place won't be open until the late afternoon, so he has all these suitcases and things out on the lawn. I'm moving out of state for the summer for work and have to go so I can catch a flight. He asks if I can put his stuff in my car (it wouldn't fit anyway) until his place opens up. I decline. 



I call him later in the day to make sure he made it to his new place on time. He did. I told him he owes his girlfriend a steak dinner for what she did. He says that he dumped her that morning"

Particularly during periods where I'm stressed and swinging from hot to cold. I feel really bad about it, but I've come to understand that it's in part due to my attachment type which leans towards avoidance. I prefer keeping people at distance, but the problem comes when I'm particularly stressed. I might open up and be vulnerable, but then because I've done that, I need space away because that is just getting too close. 

And then of course I get locked in my own head with guilt and frustration and so I don't really communicate what is going on. To someone else, I'm sure it looks like I'm just unpredictable. I know my parents have said they're sometimes unsure about how I'm going to react to something and that can be hard to hear. I feel awful about it.

I do try explaining things when I'm calmer but sometimes I don't know why I'm doing something so it makes it hard to explain to someone else. The funny thing is, is that I'm pretty sure I used to be the opposite and be almost clingy a few years ago. I guess after a lot of close friendships being torn up, it changed me quite deeply.

I went to a girls-only school and my friends (mid twenties) still act like giggly 13 year olds when they see a boy, because they never had a chance to interact with them normally on a day to day basis. Not to mention the absolute nightmare of being a transgender or non gender conforming kid in that environment. The whole conceit of gender segregation in schools is based on long-disproven science anyway. Why is it still a thing?

And while I'm on this topic, school uniforms rob kids of what little control they might otherwise have over their bodies and personal expression, and should not be the norm. They create a boring, depressing environment for kids and bar them from exploring their identities. Also, especially in the case of girls' uniforms, they give adults an excuse to police and scrutinise teenagers' bodies to a worrying degree.

DONT DO THIS, PLEASE!

If a character has physical trauma, make them flinch from fast movements or perceived anger, the tensing of muscles and the piercing stares, waiting for something to happen.

Most importantly give it a reason other than ""to show how evil the person is."" Surely there are other more subtle ways than ""Omg he kicked a dog he is such a shit hole look at him go!""

He replied ""Because your father is my father."" He explained that his father was a quadriplegic.  He could tell I loved my father and it reminded him of the relationship he had with his own father.  He and his wife had already checked their luggage, they had plenty of time to spare, so they went to the grocery store to bring back some treats with them to Australia.

I knew I needed one of the exits, and I'd recognise the buildings once I walked outside, but I was having trouble finding it.  So I probably looked a bit weird, circling this food court several times.

This lady comes up to me.  She's a got a thick accent, hard to understand.  And she starts telling me that I'm not really blind.  I'm an actor and I work for the government/a shadowy corporation? She was legitimately mentally unwell, and she would not leave me alone.  I even found a bathroom, and she just followed me in, and kep talking to me.  Eventually, she wandered off (maybe someone else finally came to my rescue; I don't remember).

A month later, I am with a group of friends, in a different food court, and the SAME lady walked up to us, and starts telling my husband how I'm not really blind, and I'm just an actor.  I was absolutely horrified.  Was I doomed to be haunted by an actual madwoman whenever I went downtown?  Happily, for me, I never saw her again after that.  I do hope, however, she was able to get some help.  Definitely my go-to for weirdest random encounter I've ever had.

I dropped him off at the hospital, gave him another hug and told him that I was glad that he was alive and that he hadn't jumped. I also gave him my phone number incase he needed anything in the future. Even though I'd only been talking to him for about an hour I had really started to like the guy.


Fast forward a week and I get a call from him while he was still at the hospital. He said that he was going into a rehab program and we made plans to meet up for dinner at a local diner. When the time came to have dinner with him he wasn't responding to any of my texts or phone calls and none of the texts I sent him registered as ""read"". I figure he either wanted to distance himself from that dark part of his life or he did actually succeed in killing himself. I really hope that it was the former. I still think about him sometimes and I really hope that he is doing well."

I became aware of a beautiful woman behind me.  She was taller and she could see over me.  She was dressed in red and black leather and had on heels.  She was sticking right behind me.  

Whenever someone got in our area, she would address them, not mean, but with an authority of, ""where are you going?""  And they would be flustered with, ""Uh... over there!?!"" She would send them on their way with a ""godspeed.""  They would go away and leave us alone.  She had friends check in, and she built up a community of people she wanted with her.  She had guys hit on her and I listened in as she sent them away as well.

By the time the last bands where playing she had a wall of people where we all kept each other warm.  I was in amazement of her ability to make a group and planning.  I never spoke to her once.

She just passed out!” I’m sure everyone thought I was insane until I started shaking her shoulder and she did not wake up.   I started yelling “Hey! Hey” another woman next to me rubbed her knuckles on her sternum, then I basically slapped her. Suddenly, it looked like all the blood rushed to her face, it turned so red, she took a breath and sat up.

“Hey you just passed out.”  “No I didn’t.” “Yes, you did, I’m so sorry but you just passed out we all tried helping you up. You wouldn’t come to. You have to go to the hospital.” “But, I just got this job.” “I’m so sorry, but you need to get help. The next stop is Lenox Hill hospital you should go there. Your job will understand”.  She got up at the next stop and solemnly left the train.”

The train actually emptied quite a bit there, and I had a seat.  This business man in a suit, on his way out, looked at me and said “good job”, in a very sincere, impressive way.  Instead of saying “thanks!”, and riding the high, I made a face, giggled and snorted in the most awkward, idiotic way that he furrowed his brow and exited. I had never felt so stupid.

Our car hit black ice, spun out, jumped passed a guard rail, rolled down a cliff/steep decline, and smashed into a tree upside down. We all miraculously were not hurt other than a few cuts and bruises, gathered our things and climbed up (er well, I was carried) the hill to the road. A bunch of other drivers saw what happened and stopped to try and help. One man assessed we were all okay, ushered us into his warm car and drove us to the nearest airport.

My husband and I were at Boots and Hearts (country music festival in Ontario) in 2015. We took a local, weekend honeymoon because we had 3 kids and this was about a month later, a long weekend so kind of a honeymoon extension I guess. 

It was the 2nd or 3rd day we were there, camping style festival and everyone was drinking heavily. We were on our way back to our tent from the food truck area when we noticed a guy roughly our age, maybe a bit younger (20-25ish I’m guessing) completely passed out, lying half in/half out of his tent in 30C heat with the sun blaring down. It looked like he’d already been sick, and even fell in it, some crusted around his mouth. 

We were fairly drunk/atmosphere high because of the festival but I stopped and knew something wasn’t right. I was legit scared this guy was dead. My husband flagged down a med cart while I tried to wake him, point fans at him, get him to drink water, pack ice on him, get him into a shaded area etc. 

About 15 minutes later, he was semi responsive though still incoherent and the med cart arrived. They had portable fans, more ice to put around him and loaded him up. I think about him probably twice a year, hoping everything worked out and that he’s ok.

On the bus route I would always see this old man pulling a red wagon and carrying trash bags. Every single morning he was out and about, cleaning up any trash he finds. None of us students knew his actual name, but he was nicknamed Crawdad in 2012. He was called that because a bad flood did not stop him, he just wore chest-high waders and switched his wagon out for a small boat. 


That town was basically spotless because of him. I sometimes wonder if he is still alive. What he did wasn't particularly impressive, but his small gesture really did stick in my head as the town was in extremely poor condition."

I just went undrafted in the 2003 draft. This is where I first heard the name of Kris Letang - a person I couldnt believe would save my life, a few months later.

I went back to my hometown Val D'Or, to meet with my girlfriend which I would end up marry for Christmas. I was driving through one of those exceptionnal snowstorm you would end up telling your kids about. I just had a freak injury, working in the shop, so I was driving my Toyota Camry with a arm in a plaster.

It was a 8 hours road, through snow and hell, with only one functional arm! This was obviously very dangerous, but I was in a hard place in my life and I just really wanted to be with my girlfriend. So I drove until I got lost - and snowed in. I remember it being around 9 pm, only, and thinking it was a matter of time before another car would take the same winding road as me and help me out.

Keep in mind this was early 2000. I didnt even had one of those bad cellphone with bad reception. I was just sitting there, hoping for glowing lights to appear behind me. My mind was running wild - I kept thinking about my future, the dream I had to play in the NHL was all but lost. Between the pratices, my bad grad at school, a girlfriend I would neglect... I got lost among my dream.

Then the snow got thickier, thickier, and I had to get out every hour or so to make sure my Camry wouldnt get snowed-in. I had a fair amount of gaz left, but I thought... what if?

What if no one pass by this road? What if I have to sleep here? Would I get frozen to death? Probably not, but I was starting to get scared. I couldnt start to walk anyway, because I was seriously lost, and I might have been miles away from the closest home.

So I did what I had to do : I slept there. I took all the clothes I had in my luggage, made myself a nice bed, and prayed I wouldnt get frozen to death, and thinking my girlfriend would be worried sick.

Just like in a horror movie, I was waken up by a loud banging on my window - giving me the scare of my life. And there was a young dude, besides his pickup. I checked time, it was a little bit past 6 a.m.

Kris Letang was there, on his route from Montréal to Val D'or, to meet players he met at a training camp. It's the team that drafted him, and for which he'd ended up playing.

My car was out of gaz - but I was so relieved to finally see someone. Kris picked me up, and we would do the road to the closest gaz station. Even at the times, he was already extremely beautiful, with his long dark hair and his dreamy eyes. I remember thinking how nice he smelled, especially for someone who just drove a long night roadtrip.

We discussed the previous draft, in which we were both, in the stands, hoping to hear our name get called. And then, he told me : '' Dont worry. Life will find a way to make you happy, just like I found you. ''

He was so confident. You could tell by the time he was a future champion. I was a bit shy, to tell the truth. But he made me feel so comfortable. He's an easy talker, he had well thought opinions on everything. Keep in my mind, we were just entering the Irak invasion fiasco, he was really informed about it. I was so enlighted. But one thing that made me doubt, is when I asked him about his future. He told me : I will make the NHL. I will play there. And I will become the first white player to play in this league.

I told him there was already plenty of white players in the league, which is still mostly played only by caucasian players. He didnt seemed to mind. And at this point, neither did I. It was just one of those perfect moment.

On the road back, I asked him to sign my plaster, which he did.

But he didnt only signed his name, after dropping me by.

He told me : ''For Kev. Just watch me, in a few years I will be known as the Penguin to play in the NHL. Kris''

I told him: there's a much better chance of that to happen, if you mean Penguin the team, and not the animal.

And then he winked, and told me ''Sometimes, Life finds a way''

And he drove away."

15 or so years ago, I was in junior high. Back then I used to take the bus home everyday after school and we would pass by a hospital.

I asked her if she was alright and if I should inform the driver (I didn’t know why I thought of that, I guess being a kid at the time I thought the bus driver, an adult, would be able to get help?). She thanked me, said no, and that she just came back from the hospital, and was told that she only has a few weeks left to live. I think about this lady every now and then.

When I was in college, I was on my way home from a class just cruising on I-75 at about 70mph.  Two cars in front me isn't paying attention when a semi slams on their brakes.  Lady rear ends the semi, and the red SUV behind her swerves to avoid the crash.  Unfortunately, they swerved into my lane, and I was completely oblivious to what was happening.  SUV clips my front end and hit the median and ended up flipping end over end and landing on the roof of my car.  Slid on my roof a 100 yards or so, had a moon roof so I could see the sparks flying as it slid across the freeway.  Car comes to a stop and I instinctively unlatch the seat belt and awkwardly fall on the roof of my car.  Tried moving after that, but couldn't.  Realized that my foot was stuck in the dash somehow, so I'm basically stuck in this upside down car.

A few minutes pass and I see this young woman appear through the passenger window.  She asked me if I was okay, to which I responded, ""I have no idea"".  She made a joke about how I was upside down and I instantly felt not so terrified.  She commented how she was really pissed she was stuck in traffic and saw my car was upside down and instantly wasn't mad anymore.  During the whole ordeal she stayed with me and talked with me to keep me calm.  Fire fighters came and helped free my foot and I crawled out my back window.  Then she proceeded to help me pick up all my textbooks off the freeway (even cracking some jokes about how that class sucked).  After this was done I kind of wander back to my car and touch the underside of my tire, and it finally hit me what happened.  I slunk down at the median and she sat down next to me.  Having her there just really helped me not freak out.

Cops came by and asked if I needed an ambulance, we both agreed I should probably go get checked out.  As a result, I got separated from my future nurse savior (she told me she was an nursing student) and I never really got to thank her.  She helped me through a really traumatic experience and I never thanked her for it.  Didn't even know her name.

A week into owning the car, I realized why I got it so cheap when my entire exhaust system fell off the car. Luckily, it came with a drivetrain warranty, so 2 weeks later, I was back in my car and loving life.

On my way to a college event downtown, I got lost in a rough part of town, and this was back before GPS on phones. I was super nervous and lost, and I remember sitting at a red light and a group of guys all turned and were staring at me from their porch. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but I think I accelerated too quickly because next thing I know, my car engine shuts off and will not start back up.

At this point I had a line of cars behind me so I put it in neutral and start trying to push my car out of the way. The whole time, the group of guys mean-mugging me are now much closer, watching me struggle.

Cars behind me start honking as I'm sweating in the summer heat trying to push and steer this hunk of metal, and all the sudden I hear this squeaky bike wheel like Deebo in Friday. A super skinny black guy wearing a dirty, stretched out white tee, riding a beach cruiser with a basket on the front, rides right up to me, and without saying a word, jumps off his bike and helps me push the car into a corner store parking lot.

I thank him for his help, but then he tells me he's a mechanic and asks me to pop the hood. I glanced at his bike basket, seeing what looked like garbage to me, and as he lights half a smoked cig up, I remember thinking ""yeah right, this guy is homeless"" and told him it was cool, I would figure it out. Truth is, I had no idea what I was going to do, and was just being a young, naive, judging little asshat.

Without hesitation, he reached into my car and popped the hood, and after about a minute, walks over to the driver side door and hands me his smoke, then sticks his head straight up under my steering wheel and starts taking panels apart. I'm starting to freak out, because I have no idea what he's doing and I'm worried he is looking for an opportunity to take advantage of me.

He peeks out from under the steering wheel, gesturing for his cigarette, and takes the last couple hits while laying awkwardly under the dash. Then he asks me one question: ""Do you smoke?"" 

HUH? What the hell is wrong with this guy? Is he trying to sell me weed? No, I bet he wants to bum a cigarette... I pull out a Marlboro pack from my pocket and hand him one, which he puts behind his ear. ""Not what I meant. You blew your engine fuse, so I put your car lighter fuse in there. It's the wrong amperage, but it should get you to auto zone where you can buy more fuses."" He turns the key hanging from the steering wheel and the car starts right up.

I'm in disbelief. Before I can even think to thank the guy, he's getting back on his bike to leave. I stop him and ask if I can buy him lunch or anything, as I didn't have any cash, just my card. ""Nah I'm not hungry."" He said, then smiled. ""Just thirsty."" I asked what he wants, and he says the 2 cheapest 40s I can find. 

I run into the corner store, grab the 2 most expensive 40s I can find, and as I come out, he flies right up to me on his bike, slams on his brakes, tells me he's in a hurry, asks me to put the 40s in his basket, then pedals the hell out of there.

I hear his squeaking wheel fade in the distance and hop in my car, and as I pull out of the parking lot, all I can think about is how ignorant and stupid my privileged ass has been my whole life. And words I have heard as long as I can remember resonated in my head: Never judge a book by it's cover."

I wasn't particularly great at poker, but I won 50 cents in a penny ante game so there's that.

Either way, we all (about 7 or us) play poker for a while, and then go out separate ways.

The next day, Igor finds me during one of the festivities and says to come back to his room that night. 15 year old me was smart enough to be suspicious, but curious enough to go for it. That night, Igor taught me most of what I know about playing Texas Holdem.

(Stranger danger yes, but at this point in my life I really didn’t have much to lose anyway.) He jumped in and we started smoking this huge blunt and he talked to me about going to jail and losing his family and children to child protection services and all of the loss and hardships he experienced from growing up as a Polynesian boy in 1960s New Zealand. Told me to appreciate what family and friends that I had and to live every day like it was my last on earth and to make peace with any wrongdoings I had done. He really put my life into perspective as a 17 year old dude who thought the world as he knew it was ending.

On the day before I was supposed to fly home after an extended visit to Washington DC, I woke up feeling really cruddy. Stomach bug cruddy. I needed to pack up our whole apartment into two suitcases and two carry ons. No food in the kitchen, so I walked to a nearby diner, in Crystal City. It's a busy place but by no means populated by gregarious, friendly people. Everybody is on a mission and probably 50% are in military uniform. 

I just wanted a bottle of apple juice, but the diners credit card limit was $5 and I had no cash. A well dressed lady behind me walked briskly up to the counter, set her order down and told the cashier to add the apple juice to her order. I think it was the first time a stranger had even acknowledged my presence in the two months I had been in DC. I just about cried. Best apple juice I ever tasted. 

Totally spent the night before we flew out puking my guts out while madly trying to fit everything into our suitcases. But I'll never forget the lady that bought me apple juice. 

In the middle of the pandemic, I ended up miscarrying a pregnancy fairly early on, maybe 7 or 8 weeks. My OB's clinic was closed that day so the on call nurse had me go to the ER to get checked out. 

My husband couldn't come in, so I waited for hours alone. It was right before Christmas, cold and bleak outside, and they kept all the doors open, so it was freezing. When my number came up to get evaluated, the older lady at the front desk asked me why I was there. I tearfully whispered that I had just lost a baby. 

She looked at me with eyes full of tears and said ""Oh honey, I've been there before too. I'm not allowed to hug you, so look me straight in the eyes here and understand - I'm hugging you. It's going to be okay."" She stood there quietly with me as I cried, two women united by a shared experience of loss and pain. 

I don't think I could have made it through that day without that honest, sweet interaction. I just really wish I could give her an actual hug now. 

There's one more stranger that that story brings to mind. Sitting in the ER that day across from me were two young sailors, one slightly older, in uniform, one in street clothes. I was confused as to what was happening, since you weren't allowed anybody with you at all. When they finally went up to the front desk, it turned out that the uniformed man was the other man's commanding officer, and he was escorting the younger sailor to the ER for involuntary commitment for attempted suicide. My own troubles of the day, though not slight (miscarriage is hell, folks) really paled in comparison to the awkward but caring dance being carried out in front of me - the vulnerable younger man who had either confessed his struggles or had been found out, and the CO, who was now forced to commit one of his sailors to psychiatric care. I hope and pray he got the help he needed."

For the serious, it was a time that I was going to be alone on thanksgiving. My roommate was out of state with family. So I went to the store the day before to stock up on groceries, and I must have been showing that something was wrong in my body language, because the cashier asked if I had anywhere to go for thanksgiving. I said no, and he invited me to a barbecue his family was doing at a nearby park. It was a very nice day with lots of food, got to play with some dogs, and just talk to people when I otherwise would not have. 

For funny, it happened while I was working in a restaurant. It was New Year’s Eve, a mandatory workday for everyone. I was scheduled as a food runner that night. Since New Year’s Eve was one of our biggest shifts, we ran a condensed menu to keep things moving quickly (it never works. We close at 9 and people were consistently staying till about 11:30 on NYE). One table, I bring out the tray, and get to this older man, probably low to mid 60s, placing the plate down and saying “Veal Classico” to confirm that it’s his, even though I have the ticket and know what seats the food goes to. This man says to me “I didn’t order the catfish. I got the pork chop.” I was completely stunned for a few seconds just trying to process what the fuck I just heard. My friend… 1) I said veal. 2) we don’t have catfish tonight. 3) we don’t have pork chop ever. Luckily his wife was there to stop my incoming stroke as she tapped his arm and said “You got the veal Ron.” I went back to the kitchen and immediately told everyone so they could be just as confused as I was."

He seemed a bit surprised and asked if I was sure. I double checked. Yup. That’s the price.
He told me that the shelf said it was $29.99. I told him that if he could show one of my coworkers where the faucet was on the shelf, we could look into it (I would of gone and helped him, but there was a line of other customers I needed to put through).
One of my coworkers and the customer came back and my coworker is holding a sale tag. She presses a few buttons on the computer and tells the customer that the sale ended a week ago and we forgot to take the tag down.
This upset the customer and he stormed out of the store cussing and saying that we don’t know how to run a business.
However. He didn’t let my coworker finish. If we leave the sale tag up by accident, we can give him the sale price.

My family and I were not very well off, but our grandparents owned a historic holiday home in the Bay of Islands (New Zealand).  We would camp in a garage there over summer and live a fairly rudimentary but fulfilling  lifestyle.

One night, just after Christmas, we heard a knock on the garage door.  It was an American family who had broken down in the middle of the night.  Our holiday home was very isolated, ho many houses around and a long way to town.  Luckily, my sister has just gotten a cell phone for Christmas (it was a massive deal back in ‘99) and she was able to call for help.  While we were chatting, I started chatted to the kid of the family about Pokémon (I was obsessed) and they noted they had a game boy with it in their car.  I’d never played as we couldn’t afford a game boy, but they said I could have a turn on it while we waited.  But alas! The batteries were dead, so I wasn’t able to but we thanked them either way. Eventually the repair truck came, fixed their car and they drove off!  We walked back to our garage to tell our parents about all the excitement.  About 10 minutes later, we heard a beeping outside the garage.   We went outside and it was the American family again waving at as.   They said thank you again when gave me the game boy and Pokémon game (red) as a present.  I was overwhelmed and couldn’t believe it, but they insisted and smiled/waved  goodbye.   It made my summer and fulfilled my greatest wish at that time!

I’ll never forget their friendless and generosity they showed to 9 year small town kiwi boy!  Although I shared remember their names or even what they looked like, it still sticks with me to this day."

I wanted to approach her and my mom brought me closer and the angel lady was so enchanting and she noticed me, gracefuly leaned foward and stretched out her hand in a 'gentleman to lady' kind of way. Except this was a purely 'you're a cite little kid, let me make your day' kind of thing. The reason I will never forget her is because that max have been the last time someone did something purely for me. Everything else that anyone has done for me came either with obligation or expectation of refusal followed by humble gratitude or guilt tripping over someone having to do something for me. Or at best, i get the cold, dont sweat it, kind of treatment. That lady simply wanted to make my day because she saw how in awe I was of her. And there was no obligation or expectation  on my side. She may have worn a mask over because I dont remember any facial expression. Just a simple gesture thats hard to describe but has stuck with me."

I'm bound to annoy most people so it'd be like $200,000.
A long way from a billion tho.

Next I'd probably go to the movie theaters with some crash cymbals on a busy night and enter each theater disrupting the movie.. anywhere from 100-400 people per theater and around 24 screens per building I could probably earn $8.5mil per building. Drive around to all the theaters I know which is about 10 theaters but not all are as big as 24 screens so after this I'd be at around $80mil.

Hmm.. oh! I could hijack a bus and then park it sideways on the highway during long weekend rush hour traffic! Pop the tires and throw the keys in a sewer. That's probably another $400,000,000 right there.

Shit I'm only about half way there and running out of ideas.

Ah! I could go to apartment complexes and pull the fire alarms in all the buildings. Between tenants and firemen wasting their time that's probably. 1000 people per building, 4 buildings per complex, this is another $4,000,000 per complex and I know of about 5 complexes so $20,000,000.

Now I'm just over half at $500,200,000.

Ah shit!! I got it!! Fuck up the power grid! Knock out a cell tower or something like that. If I knocked out power to my entire region  that's about 700,000 people which would put me over the $1billion!!! Damn after all that thinking I should of started with this one! Knock out power to a couple regions and be done with it! Lol

Such as...

**Make me King:** Now you, a mostly unqualified person, is responsible for steering the fate of a nation that probably does not like you. Smartest thing you can do is create a good constitution, step down and hold elections. I grew up during the 90s in a Christian environment, homophobia was normal and that if all atheists dropped dead it would be a moderately good thing for the world albeit at the cost of temporarily impeding economic activity. Looking at past me taught me to not be so sure of my convictions. What problem are we trying to solve by becoming king, anyhow?

**Kill Hitler**: If WWII never happens, Europe might still be full of colonial, racist empires. In the long term, it still might turn out okay for everyone, just because WII was such a damaging event to our civilization. Democracy, female empowerment, the rule of law, these things might just take a bit longer, with the upside of avoiding the disaster of WWII.

However, colonial empires are often genocidal, so Africans might prefer the destruction of the colonial empires of Europe over their continuation. Call it karmic justice if the continent is devastated in the process. Finally, the most compelling argument against killing Hitler: The conditions in Europe at the time might have lead to another world war regardless of Hitler's influence, though it would likely have been delayed by a few years. A delayed war means better technology, including nuclear. Wishes affecting the past have the same issues surrounding them as time travel, except without conditions our wishes can mess around with more than just time. Such as the conservation of energy.

**Eternal Youth:** Might put you in danger from people wanting to know the secret to your biological immortality. Medicine is advancing rapidly so this wish might be wasted on something you will eventually get anyhow.Make me rich: Being rich is a full-time job and would change your life, including your social circle. Or maybe, since our Genie is a nice one, after wishing to be rich we wake up to a life where we live in some picturesque house with a garden, surrounded by family in a nicecity with many friends and as we check out bank statements, we find that we are not rich in money, in fact we don't even own a car, but we have everything that matters.

**Wishing to never have a reason towish for anything:** Now this one is tricky. Does a fruit fly wish for anything? Are rich people happier because they can afford things you can't? What happens to conflicting wishes, like eating pizza and having an athletic body? Will the Genie shield me from calories? Has thisathletic body I never had to work for any value to me now that I cannot get obese, sick (or even die!) and the partner of my dreams will always be there and love me? This wish messes around with a central part of the experience of being human. Nothing you do will be rewarding anymore, since you have nothing to strive for. You will quickly wishfor something to wish for.

**Fix climate:** Solution might be detrimental to a lot of human interests. Instantaneous adjustment of the chemical composition and thus thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere might lead to extreme weather events as the planet settles. The oceans would be affected as well, its chemistry including acidity and its energy with unknowable effects on the already stressed marine eco systems. Many cities in the northern hemisphere have not seen a 'real' winter for over a century. Many places are no longer equipped to deal with pre-global warming winters. It would be a rough decade, maybe century.

Considering this, a less dangeros wishlist might start out like this:

1. More wishes
2. The wisdom to understand at least the size and the kind of the impact of our wishes (Might be at this point we realize we already messed up at step 1.)
3. Proceed with smaller wishes and avoid breaking time, causality, entropy, energy preservation... Or bite the bullet and wish for the rainbow to reverse colours and see if it makes straight people queer or collapses the universe."

The first season was good and the second and third were fine. After that it just got so boring. 

The flash is fast. Then an evil person shows up.Then someone on the team learns something very important but keeps it a secret from the rest for no apparent reason. Someone gets demoralized and needs a dramatic 1 to 1 peptalk to get them back on the team. Back and forth fights between flash and bad guy for 5 episodes. The secret is shared with the team and now they win. But there is a twist... Which you'll have to wait for untill next season. 

They could probably crop the entire season into 3 episodes if they just cut out the ""keeping a secret from the team"" part.

\- Most characters do either stupidly longwinded plans or have just unbelievably bad decision making. 

\- Lots of stuff is only linked to incredible good or bad luck.

The biggest drivers of inflation right now are housing, vehicle prices, fuel, and food. 

We own our house, so our monthly payment is already locked in and immune from inflation (other than perhaps some minor effects on rising property taxes). 

We own our cars, so we don't have to worry about the vehicle shortage or rising interest rates on car loans. 

My wife works at home and I work at a grocery store 2 miles from our house, so we barely drive and aren't exposed to rising fuel prices. I pick up groceries after punching out and kill two birds with one stone. 

We are spending a lot more on food, but in the grand scheme of thing it's probably been more than offset by the moderate wage increases we've gotten.

Banks' science fiction novel ""Against a Dark Background"". The novel focuses on a group led by Lady Sharrow seeking the last of the Lazy Guns.

The eight Lazy Guns were mysterious ancient objects, discovered together a long time before the events of the book.

A Lazy Gun is roughly half a metre long, 30 cm wide and 20 cm tall. On the front are two short cylinders that end in black lenses. A sight extends from the main body, as do two hand grips. A metallic strap allows the Lazy Gun to be fired from the waist. On one hand grip is a zoom control and on the other grip is a trigger mechanism. The Lazy gun is massy but light, and weighs three times as much when turned upside down. The Lazy Gun is the only weapon known to display a sense of humour.

To fire the Lazy Gun, it is pointed at the target, zoomed in, and then the trigger is pulled. What happens next is unpredictable. When fired at humans, many different things may occur. An anchor may appear above the person, giant electrodes may appear on either side of the target and electrocute them or an animal may tear their throat out. Larger targets such as tanks or ships may suffer tidal waves, implosion, explosion, sudden lava flows or just disappear. When fired at cities and other such targets, thermonuclear explosions are the norm, although in one instance a comet crashed into the city."

It basically teleports a Snotling(tiny goblin) into its target.

They are fired out of the gun, driven out of their tiny minds in the process. This has the effect of terrifying the Snotlings, making them exit the portal in a frenzy, ripping and tearing at anything they encounter as they leave the portal. This is effective because the Mek often tries to aim the gun directly on top of enemy soldiery, and they emerge inside living creatures or enemy tanks (ripping them apart from the inside) as well as landing nearby due to the very effective condensed exit point."

I once heard that the best way to utilize a power system in a story is to establish the rules of that system and then demonstrate the application of those rules. It's why I usually prefer hard magic systems in fictional series.

I like bs anime powers but more importantly I like the idea that their powers, as they are used, present a unique expression of their own individual fighting style or even just character for those who do not fight. And this is why I love nen as a ""weapon"" so much. The lore in how your personality ties into what sort of ability you are likely to have( as a side effect for fans, this allows people irl to better imagine what their own expression of nen might look like) is a PERFECT example of these two concepts in play.

I also enjoy that, much like with real life, there are limits to how potent your usage can be. You can try to force yourself into a category you aren't suited for but it's ultimately self defeating because by the time you've mastered it you've essentially wasted your potential elsewhere. 

Just as well I LOVE how structured it is. With conditions and contracts, much again like real ife, you can place restrictions or self imposed ""costs"" and in doing so your nen expression is made more powerful through that personal sacrifice. It's a literal metaphor for discipline. Like someone who wants a beach body. You can put in the years of work or you can juice up but cheating your way through can destroy your body so you are better off working harder for it. And part of that sacrifice is the time and effort spent working out and being active as well as the discipline to eat healthy.

And because of all this, the applications of nen are almost limitless but it also feels very...fair in a sense. Sure you have exceptions like our protagonists whose potential dwarfs most others to the point they leapfrog the average person...but if you pay attention they still lose most any fight against serious opponents because they lack experience which is something no amount of just natural talent can accomplish.  And overreliance on things coming easy to you can again waste your potential. Plus their nen expressions ultimately also have a ceiling. And so someone who works hard and diligently studies could eventually bridge that gap. 

But that's all detracting from the point I made in the beginning which is the main reason. To best know your nen is to best know yourself. There are those in the series who try to be things they aren't and suffer for it. But those who work hard, learn about nen and about themselves, and have a bit of luck can make brilliant use of it in way no one else would.  One of the most HAX nen abilities(has the properties of r-) is one of the most SIMPLE ass techniquess one could have int he series but it's so versatile & creatively used that it's metaphorically and literally the most flexible ability in the series. 

So yeah, Nen is cool."

Fisheye is up on his knees now and has torn away the canopy and space blanket that have covered him until this point. In one hand he is holding a long device a couple of inches in diameter, which is the source of the whirring noise. It is a circular bundle of parallel tubes about pencil-sized and a couple of feet long, like a miniaturized Gatling gun. It whirs around so quickly that the individual tubes are difficult to make out... The device is attached to a wrist-thick bundle of black tubes and cables that snake down into the large suitcase... The suitcase has a built-in color monitor screen with graphics giving information about the status of the weapon system...

""See, I told you they'd listen to Reason,"" Fisheye says, shutting down the whirling gun. ""...See, it fires these teeny little metal splinters. They go real fast - more energy than a rifle bullet. Depleted uranium.""

Decided to meet at a coffee shop. Saw her sitting waiting for me and made eye contact. I decided to wait on line since the place was packed. Ordered a Chai latte. Sat down and realized I just bought myself something without getting her anything. She ended up having to wait on a long line to get her coffee. I was dressed in just a sweatshirt with jeans and flip flops while she had a full getup. Funny thing is that relationship lasted a couple years after that date. This was early college btw. 

Can safely say that memory makes me cringe to this day. Next time I'll buy myself a coffee like a normal person."

I've observed this so many times when out and about. Just, why? Utter madness. We treat each other with no civility, patience or kindness, and then we're confused why we don't get what we want from relationships.

Mindfulness. We are reckless to each other.

How I got this allergy you may ask? 

My doctor over dosed me! 

So going back to when I was about 7-8, I got a tick on my head and my mom couldn’t get it out herself so she decided to take me to the nearest walk-in doctors office for them to get it out. 

Once they got it out they prescribed me amoxicillin and told me to take it for like 5 days. No big deal right? Wrong. 

Well about 4 days into the amoxicillin my mom decided to take me to my actual primary doctor just to double check that I’m okay. 

And he decided that I should actually take the amoxicillin for 10 days not 5 I guess because where the tick was still looked swollen so he just decided more drugs was the answer, so he gave me more.  

Oh boy did he mess up. 

Fast forward about another 4 days into taking the amoxicillin and I was at my dads house because he was babysitting me, and I had just taken my dose of antibiotics for the day. 

I was playing with some toys when I started to feel very hot and nauseous. I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror and my skin was very red, speckled and warm to the touch. 

I’ve had hives before so I knew what this was and I told my dad and he didn’t have Benadryl or anything so he decided to take me back to the walk-in doctor to have them fix me. 

Well when we went to the walk in they almost immediately took me in because by the time we had got there I started to swell up more and more and that’s when everyone realized this was some sort of allergic reaction and not just a case of hives. 

So they took me back, took some of my blood, and asked me all the questions they needed and they figured out pretty quickly that this was happening because I was still taking the amoxicillin for twice as long as I needed to. And since I was like 7 and about 75 pounds soaking wet I had pretty much overdosed myself and it made me develop an allergy to amoxicillin. 

It wasn’t nearly as serious as I thought it would be; they gave me a little Benadryl, pretty much ordered me to stop taking the amoxicillin immediately and to not take it again and sent me home. 

And that is how I gave myself an allergy to amoxicillin/penicillin products and now I hope and pray every day that I never get like an STD or something that I would kind of need penicillin for.

Also if you were curious my mom ripped my primary doctor a new asshole for basically over dosing her child, we got a new primary immediately and I found out he resigned a few years later. He was not a good doctor 😂"

Frequently drive to the closest gas station on a candy run (you should not drive while on ambien).

Painting her nails and the skin around the nails...and also the armrest of the couch. Permanently stained. 

Eating meat even though she claimed to be a vegetarian.

Get into a disagreement and then disappear from the apartment. Then text me that she went to a bar. Then I had to go get her which was a good thing because 1. she forgot her wallet and couldn't pay for her drinks and 2. someone on Ambien should not be drinking and should definitely not be at a bar.

I felt like a sex object and a mother to him more than a partner. Never any effort from him to stop lying about his kratom addiction and alcoholism, all our problems were me having a problem and not being happy enough with who I had. I was filled with contempt, I couldn’t even stand him being in a room with me by the end of our 4 year relationship. He was jealous of my success in school, and would rub in my face that he was financially better than I was and needed his help (after he begged me to quit being a CNA and go to school to pursue my dreams of being a therapist). After my best friend died he treated me like shit for being depressed and I knew that I couldn’t face another loss like that with him by my side. I lost everything, couldn’t stay in school, couldn’t find work at that time in the height of the pandemic. But I built myself back up without him. For 2 years I rebuilt my life, I now have the best job I’ve ever had. I’ve also found the love of my life, he is my best friend.

I was with my ex for 3 years. He mentally and emotionally abused me so consistently that I’m not even the same person anymore. On top of that he ruined my career and my credit because he manipulated me by making me feel like I wasn’t doing enough for him. It didn’t help that the people I worked for were also mentally abusing me as well. Regardless of that, I was very hardworking and excellent at my job. I was actually making curriculums for other managers to properly train employees. Anyway, at some point I had to move for my job and I was completely alone. He didn’t come with me because he was apprenticing to be a tattoo artist. It couldn’t be helped. The time I spent away was probably the better part of my relationship. To give examples of the abuse, I was consistently gas lighted, constantly told I wasn’t appreciative of him, he alienated me from my friends (basically that I couldn’t be friends with guys or lesbians), always wanted me to bring my girlfriends over, he treated me completely different when people weren’t around, constantly accused me of cheating, and so on. He was really insecure and jealous. My gay friend called me baby one time and he lost his shit over it. I had to explain that he was gay and wasn’t interested in me like that. He didn’t let it go for months. One time he kicked me out because he claimed that my best friend called his shop and told him that we had hooked up, which is 1)completely out of character for my best friend and 2)never happened. One of my close friends from highschool died and my ex was jealous that I was heartbroken over my loss. He proceeded to ask me if I “fucked him”. Which I didn’t, I was forced to keep my pain to myself because he didn’t want to hear about it. I’m not perfect by any means, but I am generally a very accommodating person by nature because I try to take care of my loved ones around me. For instance, he got sick. Like had sepsis from a cyst on his back. He tried to take a loan out but his credit was garbage. He pressured me into taking a loan out and promised he’d help me pay it back so it wouldn’t ruin my really good credit. I was approved for $1200. It didn’t last long. I couldn’t even afford to go to the doctor myself. I lost a lot of weight from that relationship. I was generally 125 lbs, but the more depressed I got, the more weight I lost. I was, at one point, 109 lbs. Which, for my height, is severely underweight. My face was sunken in and my skin, which was pretty clear at the beginning, was riddled with acne. He sucked the beauty out of my life. I’m not a conceited person, but I am a pretty girl. He definitely wasn’t someone I would typically date (looks wise) but I thought he was charming and funny, so I gave it a chance. I appreciate inner beauty and as the abuse went on, the only thing that really kept me there was that I looked at the good and ignored the red flags. He destroyed my self esteem with the constant mind games. I stopped feeling at all by the time the relationship was ending. I was numb, just a ghost of who I used to be. Dying seemed more exciting at the time. I had given up a job I truly did love. I gave up my independence because he consistently guilted me for being elsewhere. I had a really nice apartment and was able to support myself. I couldn’t bring my dog with me so the dog stayed with him. But I moved home, to his parents old house that his brother destroyed. We were renting it from his dad, who we later found out was pocketing the money. The house was infested with roaches and there were fleas in the only carpeted areas of the house. We did clean it and get almost right again but it was still a pretty miserable place to live. I begged him to move, an apartment would’ve been a much better option. He just told me that I was an ingrate. I found out the house was foreclosed because his dad wasn’t paying the bank. He tried to hide that from me. He started coming home later and later. There was a point that he wasn’t getting home until 4 in the morning. A couple weeks after I found out he was seeing another girl, that he had invited to come hangout with us. At that point it was an easy out. I moved out and took the $1200 guitar I bought for him. He didn’t play it once. I tried to get his part of the loan I took out and he asked me why he had to pay for everything. He did eventually pay me back, but so he could be on my good side to date one of my “best” girlfriends. Fuck that guy, fuck a fake friend too. She broke my heart when that all happened because I knew what was in store for her and she has literally listened to me cry about how I was being treated. She wasn’t treated any differently. I lost friends over that relationship. Probably for the better even though I was devastated. 
After that relationship I was nothing like I used to be. My wall was so high, it took me a long time to reconnect back to the friendship I used to have with a lot of my friends. Being around my guy friends was uncomfortable. I couldn’t trust my girl friends. I would have panic attacks and anxiety attacks. I would go to the darkest avenue of depression. I was suicidal. I felt like my purpose in life was ripped away from me. I felt lost. The only thing that saved me was going back to school. Which wasn’t great but I got my license. When I thought I could get my bearings my best friend since 2011 confessed his feelings for me. I told him it wasn’t a good idea. I knew I was a mess. What I didn’t realize at the time was that he preyed on people in a weakened mental state. Like I should have known that but I wasn’t even considering that he’d treat me that way since we were so close. He convinced me that he would help me get through my storm. I agreed to date him. He was amazing. He was sweet and kind and treated me with care. Then one day, it was like a switch went off and he stopped. He stopped treating me with kindness. He said he was too comfortable. And then the mind games. At one point I had been telling one of my friends what was going on and my best friend/bf went through my phone while I was in the shower. He was so angry. That night, he was blasting his music. I wanted to go to sleep (we shared the room). I practically begged him to turn it off and he told me to sleep on the couch. I said no. I turned his speaker off and laid on the twin sized mattress we shared. He grabbed the mattress and ripped up from under me so I’d slam into the wall. Of course, at that point, I was ready to fight him lol. I got up and we were screaming at eachother. He tried to pick me up by my shoulders to remove me from the room and I head butted him. Do not be physical with angry people. We stayed together after that because we tried to work it out, but nothing got better. I had to find us a place to live with a coworker and I was basically shunned. My coworkers roommate had a crush on him even though she had a boyfriend. I tried to tell him. But he still went places with her that I wasn’t invited to go to. Even on days I was free. He ended up hooking up with her after we broke up. That relationship lasted 5 months because I was like, nah not again. I dumped him and left him. 
I’m in a healthy relationship now and I’m happier than ever. It’ll be 6 years in April. I have a better relationship with my family. I have better friends who have been nothing but supportive and I probably wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for them."

The big one is we were both enablers to each other. We both already drank quite a bit but when you get us together we drink like they just abolished prohibition and of course us being shit faced a lot and both being argumentative when we’re drunk we fought a lot. When we were sober we worked perfectly but couldn’t get over our vices because we were ignoring personal problems. For me I was still dealing with the repercussions and trauma from my sons mom and I stopped taking my meds (I’m severe bipolar) because I wanted to feel like my natural self again and my mood swings started going over the place and she was dealing with issues with her dad, trauma from her ex who forced her into an addiction to meth (she’s been clean for a year when we met) and being undiagnosed bipolar (we are extremely similar). So after a huge fight after spending a week apart we met a the bar in the after noon and she suggested we break up. I love her to death but I understood and agreed even though my first instinct was to fight for us. But it’s been 4 years and we both are doing good both on meds.

When we broke up she said some hurtful things to me unprovoked. I always thought it was bizarre but thought hey if she says she doesn't want me anymore then she doesn't. Well back then, her ex had found out she was with me now. They threatened her that if she didn't break up with me that they'd find me and ""take care of it"". Disturbing. Though I'm thankful noone got hurt I'm sad she didn't mention any of it, I think I was entitled to the truth then, not a year and a half later. The only reason I believed her was because my best friend of many years learned about it first and told me. I never officially met my ex's ex, but I knew about them, it doesn't surprise me that they did such a horrible thing, in fact they did various horrible things, I'm just glad everyone's alright now.

4. I dated a girl who just randomly messaged me on Facebook. She got mad because she wanted to have sex and I said we couldn't because I was a senior and she was a freshman. I soon realized how stupid this relationship was and moved on.

5. We were going different paths and kind of stopped having feelings for each other. Amicable split up. 

6. I started losing my hair and she started treating me like a monster and left me for a guy with a full head of hair.

7. FWB, she said that her interests had moved on.

9. I wouldn't sign her mom's contract to protect her celibacy and her mom did everything she could to sabotage the relationship and won.

10. FWB. She stopped things and got back with her girlfriend.

We were very young when we got together. She was my first ""real"" girlfriend and because of that I saw passed the obvious red flags coming up almost every time we met up. Somebody liked me, so she must be good, right?

Well it started to stack up: Her saying she was going to beat up some other girl in broad daylight in the middle of our town which was also 5 minutes from our local police station [and could not understand why that was a bad idea], tried to baby trap me by telling me she was on birth control when she wasn't, would actively self harm [which is one thing] but it would get out of control if I didn't answer the phone to her, said some pretty racist stuff to a guy of Indian descent once then denied it ever happened, threatened to kill herself if I left her, said she WAS pregnant and ""talked in her sleep"" about how much of a good father I was going to be, acted in a disrespectful way to my parents which then lead to huge arguments with me defending her [because I was an idiot who couldn't see my parents were correct] and me coming down with bad migraines over the whole thing and many other things in between.

In the end I was about to go out for my first legal drink with friends and she lived in a different town. Soon as I told her this, she started trying to stop me saying I couldn't go out without her etc. I went anyway and realised thats not what life is supposed to be - and it all just clicked like ""fuck this"". I broke up with her the next day. Depsite this she travelled to my house to try and talk me out of it.

I was paranoid she really would try and kill herself, as she really did self harm quite badly and before she met me as well. I suggested staying friends and I really did try with that. In the very end she said something about a girl I was friends with, and I just blocked her on all platforms - by that point I just thought ""if she does do something like that, it's not my fault"" and went with it.

To my knowledge she's still alive and doing ""well"". I feel bad about the way things went with us sometimes, and hope she's taken the positives from our relationship like I have - she was the first girl I ever slept with, and I took everything as a learning experience on not running head first into future releationships.

&#x200B;

as someone who is outdoors a lot, has been a scout since i tarted school, and often goes hiking and camping, i know how important good outdoor gear is. 

and your gearneeds to be able to withstand a lot, which means that sometimes it will be very expensive, but then you know that its good quality. 

example: my brother got a pair of hiking boots in 2015/16, but grew out of them. i got them a few years ago, and while they were a bit old looking with a few tears here and there, they worked really well. literally lasted 6 years before we decided to throw them out(they gave my lil brother big blisters on both feet).

&#x200B;

i know that you can get some outdoor gear in amazing quality for a cheap price, but most of the time i recommend going for something a bit more expensive as its often really good quality."

My mom died when I was born, leaving my two toddler sisters and me, a newborn, for my traumatized father, who never wanted kids to begin with. My mom did, so he agreed. He immediately shipped me to Minneapolis to be raised by his own parents and got a housekeeper for my sisters, then age 3 and 4.

I rejoined the family at first grade, meeting my sisters for the first time. My dad was distant and non-confrontational. My sisters moved out after highschool, and so did I. He got remarried to the mother of my high school's ""hot girl"", making her my new step-sister (this was back in the mid-80s). My dad never wanted any contact with me, never made any effort at all. I called him twice a year for his birthday and at Christmas, and that was enough conversation for him.

He is now 91 and has dementia so bad he cannot be left alone for a minute. My eldest sister looks after him and texts me his status every few months. We are not a close family. I often wonder how life would be different if my mom had lived. Would I be more successful? Would I be a mama's boy? I surely would've had children of my own, but I don't like kids, since that's the attitude my own dad instilled in me.

I'm now 58, divorced, no children. Angry all the time, depressed since my last girlfriend of 20 years died in the shower one morning 2 years ago.

Let this be a brief lesson - TELL YOUR DOCTOR EVERYTHING.

My wife, at 32 weeks pregnant, went in for a routine check. Said she hadn't felt bubs move that much recently, figured she was tired. She wasn't going to mention it at first.

Doctor said it was probably nothing, but they do a scan just in case.

Result - placental abruption! (plus the baby the doctors assured us all along was a girl was in fact a boy)

That baby had to come out immediately, or it would die. It could be a few hours or a few days but it would die, and chances are take my wife too.

One very quick caesarian later (I've got time to arrange a babysitter and get to the hospital) and all is thankfully well. Though believe me, some pretty dark thoughts still linger. I try to ignore them, the whole ""what if"", and concentrate on the present. My brain doesn't work that way."

Breathing, collecting thoughts and congratulating each other. Nurse came in to hand the baby back, and my wife turned her head away from me, to face the nurse at the door. When she turned she just kinda slumped. Next thing I know, the nurse rushes into the room, hands me my newborn and tells me to sit, while she is grabbing my wife and sending an alert on the radio. 4-5 more nurses rush in, and the Dr that did the delivery. The placenta had split and there was a piece still connecting to the lining with full blood flow, pumping into an empty cavity. They were able to get it to detach and stop and clear the mess, and immediately started transfusions and everything. It was so freaking close, and traumatic."

My car had 2.5 inches of ice covering the doors, and I was unable to open the doors. Even near boiling water would cool and freeze before I could melt it away.

When I used to work there we’d close at 2am and she’d usually walk home, but he started giving her rides out of safety. She had autism and was an overly trusting person. The first time we met she declared we were besties, and not in a joking way either. Anyways, they became super close due to that, and eventually swapped numbers and began texting outside of work. 
The drama is the fact that his WIFE also worked with us. Same shift and all. So while we’re working up front, her husband and my coworker are just laughing it up and goofing off in the back. She’d always side eye them too, and rightfully so. One day she went through his phone and found all these sexual and flirtatious messages from her husband, some where he was practically begging my coworker to have sex. I read some (we were kinda close) and was shocked to find that he was basically trying to manipulate her into having sex with him. As mentioned before she was autistic and somewhat childlike(?), so while she thought he was a friend, he really had less than pure intentions. I felt bad too, because she was really a loner and obviously needed the friendship.
One day his wife came to work seething and dropped off all of his belongings, and confronts the poor girl.

Once he realized we got on and were friends outside of work he was sabotaging us and trying to pin it on the other.

One day at work I was in a meeting and one of the receptionists came in and told me I had a phone call and that it was urgent.  By the time I got to the phone, the person had hung up.  She told me that someone had called and asked why we hire pedophiles and when she told the person she didn't know what they were talking about, the person explained that they were a journalist for the local newspaper doing a story related to sex offenders and that a guy working for us was a convicted pedophile.  She of course did not follow company protocol and refer the person to the corporate communications team at HQ. Instead she told the reporter that they'd need to talk to me since I was in charge of hiring for that team.  

The thing is, the guy in question had been working long before I got hired on as the head of that team.  Like he had been there for over a decade and I had been there for like 18 months.  So I go talk to my boss (who also hadn't worked there as long as the guy in question), we figure out that the guy had been hired prior to when the company started doing background checks.  We start doing some digging and find some court records online and it turns out that sure enough, this guy in my team, was a convicted child pornographer.  His offense happened in the pre-internet days (like he had literally been taking sexually explicit polaroids of kids, including his own...really distrubing stuff).  

As a result of this we called corporate, I was banned from answering my phone (in case the reporter called back) while they came up with a plan for how to deal with the situation.  They called back a few hours later and told us the situation had been escalated and that the guy had to be fired, immediately. We informed them that he had taken the day off and they literally were like, ""call him. Now.  He's fired.  We'll have someone from HR get on the call.""  The communications people, being the idiots they were, also told us that we weren't allowed to talk to our team about this. He was fired with immediate effect and all the team knew what that for some reason, he wasn't going to be coming into work again...ever.  

Over the next few days this reporter kept trying to contact me on the phone and via email and I was permitted to respond to one email stating that I was not at liberty to discuss and they should contact corporate.  Anyway, a few days later an article appeared in a, thankfully small, local newspaper that straight up listed me as a person who hires known child pornographers, which was incredibly infuriating because I didn't hire the guy nor know anything about his past.  I had literally been in charge of the team for less than 2 years and he was an employee that I had simply ""inherited"" because he had been there forever.  

The staff were shocked when they saw the article, creeped out about having been working with a pedophile for so many years, and furious with management for not letting them know the truth about why the guy just ""up and quit"" with no warning one day.

TLDR; we found out that a guy working for us was a convicted pedophile, corporate told us to fire him but also tried to keep it secret.  An article appeared in our local newspaper about it and the staff were upset."

so things like checking your phone constantly, not listening during conversation, being very stoic and quiet and not engaging, not asking any questions or especially follow up questions during conversation, talking primarily about yourself would be examples of disinterest because you aren't showing the other person that you value getting to know them.

Whereas things like presupposing the date will lead to sex and trying to ""skip"" everything, being condescending to the other person or to waitstaff, driving recklessly with no regard for the other person's safety, cutting them off constantly during conversation, being very judgemental even of randos, talking shit about exes, or getting offended and heated when they don't behave how you want them to/being entitled are some examples of rudeness and disrespect because the other person would not feel safe with you either physically or emotionally.

Apart from that most people just mess up the vibe, have unrealistic expectations of others, or are very boring/self depreciating in their talks. It should be fun, you're getting to know a new person. Don't pedastalize them. They have flaws like you and don't want to spend time with someone who thinks they're too perfect to be worthy to date. People want someone genuine, unafraid to disagree, back up what they say, be engaging, be a little mysterious and have some depth. Someone socially calibrated enough to poke fun at them without being a shit about it. Be engaging but also understanding and a little empathetic.

In my first dorm, which was small and homey, there was one phone on the hall. In my 2nd college dorm room, we were provided a corded phone with a room-based number, which felt luxurious. I had a piece of writing published in a national magazine with a tiny writers bio, and I felt super creeped on when a rando managed to call me in my dorm room to tell me how much he liked it. That was super unusual then; now the same rando could send me a tweet 30 secs after the article went live.

In terms of distractions and being in constant contact with friends, it was all there - music, video games, TV, and talking for hours on the phone. My parents would say they couldn't understand what I could talk about for hours with people I had just spent all day in school, and I can't tell you. 

Bullying people and FOMO always existed, and it really wasn't hard to get to people with either one. No social media was necessary. Bullies were always bizarrely creative in ways to get to people (literally and figuratively). And people always had ways of advertising the highlights reel version of their life to stir envy or compete.

In other words, same shit, different medium.

I think the biggest difference is not so much that there is social media and everyone has cellphones, but that you no longer have to go through someone's parents when you call. It's having your own phone, away from adult supervision, that brings out the extra bullying that you just can't get away from. Whether you are using that phone for calling, texting, or harassing someone on social media, it's all the same."

(God forbid anyone know which teacher we were complaining about or who had a crush on who! 
 Although, if I recall, the teacher names were fairly transparent adaptations of their real names.) 

Person A would have it during first period and read the new pages and write their updates.  Then they'd slip it to person B who would read and write their updates during second period, before passing it along to person C for third period, etc etc.  You'd have to wait a whole 24 hours to get it back to read all the updates, some of which you already knew because you had seen each other, but it was still sort of fun.

Also, and I can't stress the mortification of this enough, because we all had landlines with extensions, you had to be careful that parents or younger siblings weren't listening in on your phone calls (and yes, we talked on the phone a lot, as long as our homework was done).  In my case, this meant that my dad heard me get asked out on my first date, which was embarrassing.  [The other major side effect of landlines: if you were expecting a call, you'd have to try and keep the line free so that the other person wouldn't get a busy signal.]

In college, we all had landlines in our dorm rooms, with a very specific pattern that mapped dorm room number to phone number.  So if you knew where someone lived, you also knew how to call them.  Which, again, we did a lot.  And we had to get calling cards with lots of minutes on them if we wanted to call anyone long distance.  That was a very common thing to ask for for Christmas."

Other nations proclaim, ""Oh, we have freedom of speech, too! Except for the opinions we don't like, of course.""

This is a foolish, dangerous policy to have. The whole point of freedom of speech is to protect unpopular opinions. Sure, it seems reasonable on the surface for Germany to outlaw saying ""Heil Hitler,"" for example. But the question is, who decides what counts as ""hate speech?"" Would you trust this power in the hands of the worst person you know?

As far as I'm aware, only America has *true* freedom of speech. And that's why I'll never live anywhere else, short of another civil war."

*""Lord, help me, I can't change""*

That strikes me to my soul.  How many times I've tried to change my self-destructive ways.  How many times I've tried to make better choices, pick better friends, develop better spending habits.

And time and time again, I'm faced with the fact that I'm often my own worst enemy.  

If you touch a hot stove, you get burned.  You remember that!  And you are very very careful not to touch the stove again.

You ignore your better judgement with money, and you suffer, but for some reason, you NEVER LEARN.  At least I don't.

it's written in the pov of the singer as his friend comes out to her mother as a lesbian and it goes badly. the line ""...and she is begging you not to cut your hair, cause curly hair don't look good cut short"" refers to the mom asking the friend not to cut her hair, short hair being heavily associated with and also a metaphor for lesbianism. cutting my long curly hair was one of the first steps i took in my journey of gender-expression after coming out as a lesbian myself. in the second verse the singer mentions that he is the one who cut his friend's hair for her. he was there when she came out because she asked him to be, even though, in his words, ""...what is the point if i stay? there's not that much i can say. i never really even knew your mom, anyway."" he is a true friend, and that really gets to me. also a whole lot of generational trauma and baggage sours my own mother's generally positive reaction to my coming out. i could never be the daughter she wanted. the mother in the song isn't angry that her daughter is gay; she's absolutely devastated. she's described as ""crying in the bathroom"" while she pleads with her daughter not to cut her beautiful curls. her heart is broken. and if it wasn't for such a fucked up reason, you'd almost feel bad for her. imagine being her daughter and knowing you're the cause of that anguish. it gets you thinking, ""how could the daughter do that to her mother? the woman who raised her?"" i don't want to hurt my mom, but the song reminding me that i probably already have anyway makes me weep every time i hear it nonetheless."

It's a really touching and beautiful song about death.

The second part (The Web) is about refusing to accept death. The third part (Melt Away) is about after they actually die.

Most people still haven’t settled down at 30 and almost nobody I know has a baby. Those who do are in their mid-30’s and married.

I have thick ribs from Merle's tasty Rainbow Stew being spoonfed to me by my American mother when I was a small bit. 

All the good stuff was played on record, so I know and love the songs.

Authentic country, however; none of that upmarket pop-hybrid crap. 

I appreciate most of the sub-genres too, e.g., insurgent, bluegrass,  etc."

Finally, after about 2 years of going to country shows, keeping up with the music, I went full circle back to where I started.

You know those songs where you can pretty much guess the lyrics and the chords as it's playing, but you've never heard it before? That's country.

I always say, country and hip hop are the same: every song is about where you're from, what cred you have in the scene, your car, drinking, sex. It panders.

Not the stuff we listed to and were “into” just because it was popular and cool amongst peers, but the music we actually truly liked. Tastes do evolve and expand over time, but there’s a reason why our parents listened to the Oldies station - it’s the music of their youth (as I’m typing this I’m realizing that 90’s music is the new Oldies station, Jesus Christ).

So maybe for a lot of people it’s just what they were exposed to growing up, what brings back memories, and what shaped their musical preference going into adulthood."

A lot of the vocal and instrumental delivery comes off exactly the same. When you hear a Johnny Cash, John Denver or Willie Nelson song that is not the case.

Another thing is that so much of it is about a very specific type of lifestyle which I don’t lead. I don’t honky tonk, go mudding, ride tractors or have call to be down backroads, etc. This alienates me from a lot of the songs because there is nothing for me to connect to, whereas it used to be a lot more about life in general and the fun and struggles along the way living it. And I get there have always been some songs about the country lifestyle specifically, but it wasn’t nearly as prolific as it was now, and historically when they did that there was a quality about how they did that which made you feel like you could relate anyway. Sort of like you were invited in to a party, where modern ones feel like they are telling you about one you aren’t/won’t be invited to.

Finally, connected to that last point but deserving its own focused mention, I don’t like how many songs bring up God/Jesus/The Bible etc. I’m not a religious person and having lyrics pushing Christian beliefs down my throat every other song is exhausting. I don’t care if others believe, by all means do your thing, but when these songs are pushing a certain “correct” outlook on the religion question constantly it outs me off the music completely. Again I think it comes down to the approach, because Johnny Cash brought up God in many of his songs but it wasn’t preachy how he did it and never bothered me, where modern songs bring it up in a way that smacks of propoganda for conservative values. And I just don’t need preaching or politics in my music if I’m not specifically looking for some that addresses those subjects.

Tl;dr Modern country music feels like it’s made for a specific group of people with specific beliefs and a lifestyle I don’t share, so it’s off-putting. Still happy to enjoy old country though."

That was untill foreigners came over, hovering above the ground with fire blazing from their hands, but unlike the last airbender, they were friendly, just a group of explorers. As it always is in dreams, they approached me, saying that they come from another island, far behind the fog (or clouds?) that covered the horizon. They told me that elemental bending is rather simple, the secret is in the position of fingers and palm, so, naturally, i quickly learned and we went to said island. It was filled with people in colorful dresses, all knowing some sort of elemental magic, i was free to ram the island and talk to people.

The plane was fully intact and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Everyone that survived was freaking out and even though I am afraid of the water, I was completely calm and all I wanted to do was open the plane door. I reached for the handle when some guy yelled at me “Hey! What are you, crazy?? Don’t open that!” But I did anyway. When I opened the door it was like a perfect air bubble had formed around the plane. There was coral on the ground and fish flopping on the sand. There was schooling fish swimming just outside the bubble, it was incredible. But it only lasted a few seconds before the air bubble collapsed in on me and I woke up."

(EST)). I had a dream that both me and my aunt slept on the couch.

We weren't really asleep, she doesn't fall asleep quick and it was probably around 10 pm in the dream.

We saw my neighbor, a tall and decently built guy (will be needed for the story later), walking inside his house in pajamas and slippers and holding a knife. This being a dream, the weapon changed constantly for no reason whatsoever. Lights in his house turned on for a bit, but we couldn't see inside. Piss yellow windows.

Maybe 1-2 hours later in trippy dream time, he exited his home and circled mine. I told my aunt he was outside, and she got up and turned on the light when he was looking in the kitchen window (no door between kitchen and livingroom, small house).

The neighbor went to inspect my grandpa's car (2002 mountaineer I think) and my aunt went outside and opened the back passenger door. The guy was looking in the front driver.

The guy circled around the car and held a big ass machete to my aunt's stomach and repeatedly stabbed her, until he saw me. When he saw me, he just turned to me and held the machete in the air to me (probably to see if I'd run).

I told my aunt to go call the cops or get my grandpa or something, but she just looked down and said theres nothing she can do (how she did this? I dunno. A second later my dream portrayed her as dead against the front door). She was right, cuz the guy would've killed her.

I started screaming, crying and running. I got down the driveway and to the corner of the street, but then realized something and gave up running. I realized that I'm not gonna outrun the neighbor. He's a decently built guy, and I'm a girl with barely any meat on her bones and no stamina.

I turned around. The neighbor went to stab me, and I woke up.

Edit: Fixed a mistake."

It did give me pause at first when he first started wooing me because I wasn't sure if he was serious about me or if I'd be another one night stand. However, he was consistent in his actions and words regarding that was something he'd done but wasn't willing to do anymore, he wanted something steady and long term. 


It helped his case that he'd always been honest with his previous lovers about how he wasn't looking for anything serious back then, and didn't lead anyone on, wasn't a jerk, didn't mistreat anyone, and isn't hated by any of his ex-lovers. This was easy to verify, in fact, since his count was so high there was a chance I could randomly strike conversation at a checkout line and they'd know him.


We were in our late twenties when I agreed to go on a date after over half a year of consistent courtship.  Dated 2 years, been married for 5. And honestly, his hoe past actually makes me feel safer about our long term prospects. Very low chances of a ""missed out on experiences when young, want to live them now"" midlife crisis.

I literally have never seen it work out. 

As someone who got played and destroyed by someone who seemed like such a good person only to find out they were a hoe. Not former but always. 

Most are just pretending not to be or think that they aren’t while talking to everyone that looks decent on messenger all night and you and saying the same shit to you all. 

Happened with another former how who seemed grown up and I’d known him a long long time. 

He seemed different and he was all “let’s go on a real date.” Blah blah. 

Then casually weeks later he tells me he got cheated on and broken up with by two different women in the same week. 

While he was acting like he was in some serious thing with me and talking to me non stop. 

So he just jumps from girl to girl while speaking to girls online so he always has a backup or pool of options. 


It’s insane to me and it disgusted me so I deleted his number and contact on everything. 

He really felt bad for himself and was trying to convince me to come over like we are really close friends when in reality I’m sure he wanted to use me to boost his ego. 

Neither of them were super attractive either. 


This was like 10 years or more from the past so they seemed like a former hoe but they weren’t. 

I don’t think people change that much.  

Also with former the thing is knowing their past is weird and makes you always wonder and worry. 

Im a female talking about my experience with males. 

Even when I thought he changed to former and not current man whore I felt weird when seeing really nasty bottom of the barrel young girls that he had dated and then came to find out he also cheated on. One was a teenager and she was extremely white trash and gross. Just knowing he had been with girls like that made me feel uncomfortable. 

I also knew he used to be a really big slut in Highschool which I didn’t care because Highschool doesn’t define you and I thought he changed but thinking back I know of tons of girls he cheated on or with and never wore protection so I would never feel comfortable with him. 

At this point it seems like these type of dudes have some major insecurities and use girls to fill them and cover them up.  I don’t think you can change unless you can see that and admit it."

It is hard, because internet is full of half-naked women. Advertisers are fucking men over with thirsty sexual content.

If you can't manage the cold turkey. The first thing you can do is cut down porn and masturbation to 2-3 times a week. Keep it as short as possible, you will feel unsatisfyed, but the urge will lessen or go away.

It would be best to replace your porn sexual stimulation with real life women. Find local events that intrest you (on FB for example), do not creep but look around respectfully. Checking out women is socially acceptable if you look decent (showered, groomed, fitting clothes). Fantasize and masturbate later. If you go too far into fantasyland that you start to feel rapey in real life, stop, take 2 hours in the evening to lie down and meditate or think. Go back to porn if you start making real non-consensual plans of action.

You will relapse with porn. This is normal, just try again later.

Now, my daughter is really expressive, she tells me she loves me any time I do something nice for her and gives me big hugs.

The nice old lady saw that and told me this: ""Congratulations, she seems to really love you, and that tells me you have a good heart. You remind me of my pops. You are her hero, but the world is an unforgiving place... when she is older and she makes a mistake, when she trips and is about to fall again, do not side with the world. Grab her arm, hold her hand and be a hero to her once more. You will see the same grateful and cute smile you just saw, but it will have 100 times more impact. It will make all the difference"".

That game was the shit on release. Having the ability to fly in an MMO was revolutionary at the time. Sure, it was limited to small sections of each zone, but it was absolutely awesome. Also, it was a very pretty game. It came out at a time when the old MMOs were beginning to look very dated. People were looking for that next step of evolution.

The problems began 2 years after the Western release. Gameforge took control of the game and made it free to play. Then they progressively infested it with microtransactions and gacha bullshit. Aion today is like the roach in Men in Black wearing an Aion suit.

I think artists, yes on top of contributing to the production of many things from a more pragmatic standpoint, I think also harbour a far less acknowledged value in a more abstract dimension of this argument.


Generally, artists are dreamers, people who can produce something beautiful and compelling from thin air, things that are nice to experience yes, entertaining etc, but also things that reach people, that can make them reflect and grow, whether those people are artists too or not. Art is, as I see it, a language for the soul, and I think the world needs people who can speak to that. So that, among all the ways our existence in this current world has of making us cold and grounded, and stagnant, there will always be people to remind us of the single most important aspect of what sets us apart from everything else on this planet: not strength, or speed, or even our wits, but our boundless potential to create and through our imagination bring things into the world that enrich us where they did not exist before.


I see this as a vitally important thing for us. Without art I believe humanity would grow to be something boring at best, and downright ugly at worst."

Anyway spent ages getting ready looking forward to finally hooking up with this babe. He shows up at my door and it's the first time I've ever seen him out of uniform. He's wearing a shirt made out shells and this African headdress thing. It had feathers and gold discs and a tonne of beads(I'm black by the way, he was not). I ask him what he's wearing and he said he thought it was cool. Our language barrier wasn't the best so I just let it go. We went to the movies saw 2001: A space odyssey, we left at interval. I said I was feeling tired and wanted to get home. Seriously that outfit was so fucking weird and bizarre it killed all my lustful desires.

To make matters worse, upon first meeting, she pulled up for the hug, and I shook her fucking hand like the goddamn president.

Conversation went alright, but at that point, I was internally dying on the inside and wanted the filthy floor to swallow me up - Elmer Fudd impersonation on full tilt, and my face swathed cherry red.

I went to tinder to occasionally entertain myself, I met this really nice guy who shared all the same interests as me. We decided to meet up weeks after.

We met in this pub, and as the date went on.. I realised there was no chemistry and awkward at some times. It’s the way he carried the conversation so essentially, I was weirded out and couldn’t wait to leave. Towards the end of the date, he mentioned he has autism and then it all finally made sense to me. 

I’m not calling this the worst first date because of his autism but because I was clueless the entire time and felt bad later at how I reacted with some of the things he said. I’m not sure if it was my fault for not detecting the obvious or him not mentioning it beforehand. But anyways, he was a nice guy though I never saw him again."
